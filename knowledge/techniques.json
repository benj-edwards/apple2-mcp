        "2. Place 12 pieces per team in 4x3 grid formation",

        "6. IJKL movement controls, SPACE to select/fire",
        "7. Slingshot aiming: pull cursor away from piece, direction determines launch vector",
        "8. Physics: velocity (VX,VY), 0.9 friction, 0.8 wall bounce",
        "9. Collision: distance check, deal 1 damage, bounce off",
